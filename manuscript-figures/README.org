#+title: Figure 1

To make these figures use the =run.sh= script, to remove old figures use
=clean.sh= and if you want to avoid needing to install all the packages use the
=shell.nix= file to create a suitable shell.

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) Map

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-map.png]]

=figure-1-t0-map.R= produces a choropleth showing the \(T_0\) across the
globe.

** Figure 1 Cases And Deaths

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
[[./output/png/figure-1-cases-and-deaths.png]]

=figure-1-cases-and-deaths.R= produces the time series of confirmed cases and
deaths along with the LOESS smoothing.

*IMPORTANT* The values from USA and India have been removed because they are
effectively outliers.

The smoothing is obtained by first taking the average of every countries values
for each day and then running a 7-day rolling median over the resulting values
to smooth out weekend effects.

** Figure 1 \(T_0\) and GNI per capita

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
[[./output/png/figure-1-t0-and-gni.png]]

=figure-1-t0-and-gni.R= produces the scatter plot looking at GNI per capita as a
predictor of \(T_0\). The regression is a power law, but on the log-log scale it
appears linear. There is a summary of the model fit in the file
=output/txt/figure-1-t0-and-gni.txt= and the actual figure appears in
=output/png/figure-1-t0-and-gni.png=. The outlier at 25 days is from China.
